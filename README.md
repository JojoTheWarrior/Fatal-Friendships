Controls
Fatal Friendships utilizes the conventional WASD controls for movement and selection. The M key is used for progression and selection (replaces the usual Enter button). 
On the splash screen, utilize the mouse to start the game.

Note:
Due to issues from different operating systems, listeners may sometimes not focus. In particular, during the gameplay, if you ever notice that your keyboard inputs are not registering, you can easily fix this by Alt - Tab'ing out and back into the window (works 100% of the time).

Level I
The objective of this level is to progress throughout the dialogue. The user is to select responses to statements or questions as they deem appropriate. Be careful, as some of your choices matter later in the game!

Level II
The objective of this level is to progress through the rooms from one corner of the map to another. Each room has a question which must be answered to continue progress.

Level III
The objective of this level is to utilize previous knowledge in more immersive gameplay - in the style of a dodging game. The user is to answer questions using the arrow keys while dodging projectiles using WASD.
